## FizzBuzz

### About Project:

  This is a simple FizzBuzz program that outputs the numbers from 1 to 100 with the following rules:

      For multiples of 3, output "Fizz" instead of the number
      For multiples of 5, output "Buzz" instead of the number
      For multiples of both 3 and 5, output "FizzBuzz" instead of the number
